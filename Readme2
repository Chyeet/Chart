Chart frequently attempts to get the user to subscribe to my youtube channel, 'Chyeet'.

I am not actually that desperate for subscribes, it is a joke.

It does this, then opens a strobe gif blinding the user.
Chart randomly opens my youtube channel between 5-20 seconds.
And finally Chart5.exe shuts down the user's computer.

Once again, I am NOT responsible for any damage done. This is only for comedic purpouses.
